# Surface-Defect-Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Network
The proposed idea is to use convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify defects on the semiconductor wafer substrate. There are total 7 classes to be classified. Data augmentation by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is applied on 2 of the classes to improve classification accuracy.
